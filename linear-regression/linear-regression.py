# Imagine youâ€™re looking for a job as a software engineer. And you spotted a company that you want to work for. 
# You already have 4 years of experience working as a developer, and you want to see how much you can make working
#  in this company based on the number of years of experience you have. 	

# Well, the good news is you have a dataset of the salary of all the employees in the company and their number 
# of years of experience respectively. This is the perfect opportunity to apply linear regression to predict your salary! 

# You must be able to visualize the result with a scatter plot by using Matplotlib library. 
# The image below is the end result of the test set that is expected to be displayed.
