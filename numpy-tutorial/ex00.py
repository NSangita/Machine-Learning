# Exercise 00: Creating a numpy array

# Create a Numpy array. A NumPy array is a grid of values. 
# They are similar to lists, except that every element of an array must be the same type. 
# Write a program that will print the following output.

# Desired output:
# #> [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]

import numpy as np 

arr = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])

print(arr)
